			Is gender useful in predicting found?
			Turns out the answer is: <em>sometimes</em>.
			<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/">Eric Barker</a> found <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/05/how-many-women-pay-for-online-porn/">an interesting quote</a> from the book "A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire" that gives an example of when it can matter.

		<blockquote>
			The most popular paysites featuring adult videos, including Brazzers, Bang Bros, and Reality Kings, typically attract an audience that is around 75 percent men.
			Of course, that does mean that one out of four visitors is a woman -- a minority, though a significant minority.
			But when it comes to actually paying for porn, the gender gap widens into an abyss.
			According to CCBill, the billing service most commonly used by the online adult industry, <strong>only 2 percent of all subscriptions to pornography sites are made on credit cards with women's names.
			In fact, CCBill even flags female names as potential fraud, since so many of these charges result in an angry wife or mother demanding a refund for the misuse of her card.</strong>
