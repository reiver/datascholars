					Data scientists are often interested in getting their hands on (suprise, suprise) <em>data</em>.
					It is the "currency" of their vocation.
					Sometimes they have to go to great lengths to gather the data set themselves.
					And sometimes people will "give" it to them.

				The Vancouver city government has done just that.

				Meet <a href="http://vancouver.ca/data">Vancouver Open Data</a>.
				(They are also on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VanOpenData">@VanOpenData</a>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				There is some interesting stuff in there.
				Things such as data on crime, election results, voting zones, property taxes, rapid transit, schools, trees, homeless shelter locations, etc etc.
				But that's just what caught my eye.
			</p>
			<p>
				Explore the data sets they offer yourself.
