			If you were at the new <a href="http://datascholars.com/post/2013/03/11/data_science_meetup_vancouver/">Data Science meetup group</a> in Vancouver on <time datetime="2013-03-27">Wednesday</time>,
			then you saw a great introductory Data Science talk by <a href="http://donturn.com/">Don Turnbull</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/donturn">@donturn</a>).
		</p>
		<p>
			He covered a lot!
			And I think every two slides he put up could have been expanded upon and turned into talks of their own! :-)
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to have my video camera ready to film it, but it didn't work out that way.
			But, even without that, Don has made the slides of his talk available.
