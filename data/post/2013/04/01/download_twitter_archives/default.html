			Researchers rejoice.
			Through the work of 
			<a href="http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/node/465">Bárbara Poblete</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/bpoblete/">@bpoblete</a>),
			<a href="http://www.di.uniovi.es/~dani/">Daniel Gayo-Avello</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/PFCdgayo/">@PFCdgayo</a>)
			and
			<a href="http://graves.cl/">Álvaro Graves</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/alvarograves/">@alvarograves</a>)
			there are <a href="http://tweetsforscience.org/">number of full Twitter tweet archives available to download</a>.
			Get them at <a href="http://tweetsforscience.org/">#Tweets4Science</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			(Also, if you are so inclined, consider donating your Twitter tweet archive too.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I do think that these Twitter archives will likely be unrepresentative in a lot of ways.
			So keep that in mind as you look at them.
			But nonetheless they still can be useful.
		</p>
		<p>
			It actually wasn't too long ago that one could just go to Twitter and pull people's full tweet archives.
			But Twitter has become more restricitive with their API and data access.
			So archives like these are becoming more and more important.
