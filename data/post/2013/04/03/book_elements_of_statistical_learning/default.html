			Statistics is a fundamental part of our vocation.
			<em>We live it and breathe it</em>, so to speak.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus, interesting books on statistics tend to catch my attention.
			And when they are also freely available, even better :-)
			(Although with this book, you can also buy a copy of it, and help the authors out.)

		<p>
			One such book that seems worth a read is:
			<a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction</a>.
		</p>

			The book is written by
