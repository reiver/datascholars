			<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a popular environment for statistical computing and graphics.
			<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2013/000559.html">R version 3.0.0 has been released.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			From the release e-mail:
		</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2013/000559.html">
			<p>
				Major R releases have not previously marked great landslides in terms of new features. Rather, they represent that the codebase has developed to a new level of maturity. This is not going to be an exception to the rule.
			</p>
			<p>
				Version 1.0.0 was released at a point in time when we felt that we had reached a level of completeness and stability high enough to characterize a full statistical system, which could be put to production use. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Version 2.0.0 came out after strong enhancements of the memory management subsystem as well as several major features, including Sweave.
			</p>
			<p>
				Version 3.0.0, as of this writing, contains only really major new feature: The inclusion of long vectors (containing more than 2^31-1 elements!). More changes are likely to make it into the final release, but the main reason for having it as a new major release is that R over the last 8.5 years has reached a new level: we now have 64 bit support on all platforms, support for parallel processing, the Matrix package, and much more.
