			The "currency" of a <em>data scientist</em>'s vocation is (surprise, surprise) <em>data</em>.
			Sometimes data scientists have to go to great lengths to gather the data sets themselves.
			And sometimes people will "give" it to them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The government of Ontario has done just that.
		</p>

			Meet the <a href="http://www.ontario.ca/government/government-ontario-open-data">Ontario Open Data portal</a>.
		</p>
