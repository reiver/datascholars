			<a href="http://twitter.com/tslevi">Tommy Levi</a>, a data scientist in Vancouver,
			is giving giving an interesting talk on Wednesday June 26th at 6:30 PM.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tommy will be speaking at a combined meetup event for the 
			Vancouver-based <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DataScience/events/122946072/">Data Science group</a>,
			<a href="http://www.meetup.com/MachineLearning/events/122946682/">Machine Learning group</a>
			and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-R-Users-Group-data-analysis-statistics/events/124317472/">Vancouver R user group</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			(At the time of writing, over 200 people have registered for the talk.
			So there is obviously a lot of interest.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is Tommy's talk's abstract:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<b>Analyzing User Behavior at Plenty of Fish: Data Science in the Wild</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				How is Machine Learning and Data Science actually used in the real-world?
			</p>
			<p>
				Tommy Levi tells you how, and goes into the details of how he has been using them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tommy will walk through the opening steps (and missteps) he took in starting to analyze user behavior on the Plenty of Fish site.
				He will discuss data preparation and wrangling, parallel computing and initial exploration and feature analysis.
				The goal of the talk is not to focus on any specific algorithms, but to show the steps taken for a real world analysis on large, often messy data and how to get actionable, useful results from such an analysis.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			If you are in the Vancouver area, and are interested in Data Science or Machine Learning, you should be there.
