				This article reports an empirical investigation of the accuracy of rules that classify examples on the basis of a single attribute.
				On most datasets studied, the best of these very simple rules is as accurate as the rules induced by the majority of machine learning systems.
				The article explores the implications of this finding for machine learning research and applications.
