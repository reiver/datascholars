			OK, the headline for this is an exaggeration,
			but the analytics shown here were created using some techniques that one might use when doing data science.

		<h1>Bora Zivkovic</h1>
		<p>
			<a href="http://coturnix.org/">Bora Zivkovic</a> is well know <em>science blogger</em> and editor at <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bora recently downloaded his Twitter archive, and asked for help in analyzing it.

			I decided to help him out.

			<h1>Boraz's Personal Analytics</h1>
			<p>
				A popular post on <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">personal analytics is by Stephen Wolfram</a>
				(of the Mathematica and "A New Kind of Science" fame).
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing Stephe did in that post is to show a graph that gave a sense of patterns of when he was posting e-mails during the days, over time.
				The graph is reproduced in <strong>figure 2</strong>.

			<p>
				Bora's Twitter archive isn't a "third of a million" in size, but it still has some size.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here I have created a similar for Bora Zivkovic twitter archive.

			<p>
				You get a sense that Boraz does sleep at certain time :-)
				Or at least stops tweakng.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, I am aware that tweeting can be automated.
				So seeing a cross on the graph doesn't mean that Bora necessarily posted it himself.
			</p>
			<p>
				You also get a sense that Bora has increased the how much he tweets over time.
