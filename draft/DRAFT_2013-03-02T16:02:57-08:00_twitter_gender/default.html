				Can you use <em>machine learning</em> and <em>statistics</em> to predict the gender of someone on Twitter?
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Male or Female?</h2>
				<p>
					If you have spent any kind of time online, then you have probably heard of the various (online) <em>social networks</em> out there.
					Things such as <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Orkut</em>, <em>VK</em> (popular in Russia), <em>Mixi</em> (popular in Japan) and <em>Twitter</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of these social network require you to tell them whether you are a <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>.
					(To some, this information is invaluable.)
				</p>
				<p>
					However, Twitter doesn't
				</p>

				<h2>Twitter</h2>
				<p>
					<img src="bird_blue_48.png" style="float:right;" />
					Twitter in particular, is an interesting social network.
					Both from the point of view of someone using it.
					And from the point of view of someone doing research.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> has made it easy for people to sign up.
					Some websites want to know all your (deepest darkest) details before they let you sign up.
					Twitter doesn't.
					All a person has to provide to Twitter to sign up is a <em>name</em> and <em>e-mail address</em>.
					That's it.

				<p>
					(You don't have to tell Twitter <em>where you live</em> or you <em>date of birth</em> or <em>gender</em>, etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					And really, the <em>name</em> doesn't even have to be real.
					Using a pseudonyms or any other name you want to use is just fine.
					If you want your name on Twitter to be "Panda Puncher", go right ahead.
				</p>
				<p>
					(This is one of the strengths of Twitter in my opinion.)

				<h2>Inferring Gender</h2>

				<p>
					Even though Twitter doesn't ask for your <em>gender</em>, doesn't mean no one cares about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					(People involving in <em>advertising</em> care about it a lot, for instance. And so do people involved with <em>identity</em>.)
				</p>
				<p>
					But if someone doesn't self-assert their <em>gender</em> (to say they are <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>), <strong>can we infer someone's gender from their Twitter account?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd says the answer is "yes".
					(Probably because I've already worked on commercial projects that did <em>gender prediction</em> with similar type of data :-) )
				</p>
				<p>
					I think you can infer someone's gender without them <em>telling you</em> what it is, based on <em>clues</em> they leave around, with varying degrees of certainty.
					I can even think of different ways of doing it.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>

					<p>
						For example, consider the profile of a friend of mine of Twitter, in the following figure:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="harpersnotes-clues.png" />
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/harpersnotes">@harpersnotes</a> with 3 clues useful for <em>gender predication</em> marked in red.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						The first clue is the <em>avatar image</em>.
						A <em>photo</em> was used.
						We could use <em>computer vision</em> to infer the gender of that image.
						(Or even use humans to categorize it, if we had to.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The second clue is the <em>given name</em> ("Richard").
						Many <em>given names</em> are highly gender skewed.
						(I suspect there probably <strong>a lot</strong> more males with the name "Richard" than there are females.
						Which would probably make it a "good" <em>gender predictor</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The third clue probably seems less obvious, but the Twitter profile <em>description</em> can also give a clue to the gender.
						It could be that males and females use language differently, and that the language used in the <em>description</em> is a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is actually a fouth clue not marked in the <strong>figure 1</strong>.
						The Twitter screen name ("@harpersnotes").
						Like the third clue, it could be that males and females use language differently.
						And thus the words used the Twitter screen name could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, as a possible fifth clue also not shown in <strong>figure 1</strong>, it is conceivable that the location could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
						Perhaps not the location ("Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA ") in <strong>figure 1</strong>,
						but say if the location is somewhere where there is a strong gender skew, like India or China, or even like a remote mining town in Northern Canada where the only people living there are workers, and all the miners are males.
					</p>
					<p>
						(And Twitter does offer us other <em>clues</em> not shown in <strong>figure 1</strong>.
						Perhaps the Twitter user ID gives us a <em>clue</em>.
						For example, if more males signed up for Twitter in the first 3 years that Twitter existed, and we know that Twitter user IDs with a range between certain numbers are from that era,
						then we can predict <em>male</em> for all users with Twitter user IDs we think are from that era, and predict nothing outside of that.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Now obviously, in general, some of these <em>clues</em> are going to be better <em>gender predictors</em> than others.
						(Perhaps the <em>given name</em> is a better <em>gender predictor</em> than the <em>avatar image</em> because many people don't use photos for their <em>avatar image</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						And for specific profiles, which is <em>gender predictor</em> is accurate will vary; but we expect trends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's an example of another friend whose profile really gives us no clues, or barely any, as seen in the following figure:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="rnadomtc-clues.png" />
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 2.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/rNadomtC">@rNadomtC</a>.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Probably not much in the way of clues here.
						Not unless <em>not giving clues</em> is gender skewed :-)
					</p>
					<p>
						(Note that I'm not trying to list out every possible data source that may be useful for <em>gender prediction</em>.
						I am only trying to give you a "flavor" of the strategies that could be used.
						Is there a gender skew with the apps people use and which send tweets to twitter?
						Is there a gender skew in the <em>time of day</em> people tweet, or retweet, etc?
						There are many possibilities.)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Accuracy</h3>
					<p>
						Now, this doesn't mean a single <em>gender prediction</em> strategy will always be 100% accurate.
						(There is very likely going to be some level of error.)
						But these strategies will have some level of accuracy.
						And even with an error, these <em>gender predictions</em> may still be useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						You could even (somehow) combine these different <em>gender prediction</em> strategies together, to create a single <em>more accurate</em> strategy for <em>gender prediction</em> with a lower error rate.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						Developing a <em>gender prediction</em> "engine" really could be done by just taking a reference data set of known male and female accounts and doing some analysis work.
						(I.e., get a set of Twitter accounts that you know the gender for, and use some statistics, machine learning and educated guesses to discover differences between various <em>things</em> that are more common with males than female, and what <em>things</em> are more common with females than males. And use that to come up with a model you can use for making <em>gender predictions</em>.)
						And then validate the resulting model against another (separate) set of Twitter accounts for which you know the gender.
						(Just to verify that your model is a "good" one.)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Tweets</h3>
					<p>
						Another <em>clue</em> I haven't yet mention (because I wanted to save it for last) are a person's tweets.
						Specifically, the text found in a person's tweet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Are there differences between the way males and females tweet?
						I suspect so.
					</p>
					<p>
						And in fact, a team of 3 (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/">David Bamman</a>, <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/">Jacob Eisenstein</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~tylers/">Tyler Schnoebelen</a>) did <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4567">some analysis work</a> to find some differences.
