					Sometimes the data you are dealing with is a <em>graph</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
					Before you even start considering how you will view your graph data
					(such as by using <a href="http://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> or <a href="http://graphexploration.cond.org/">Guess</a>, etc)
					you need to (serialize and) store you graph into some kind of <em>file format</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
					If we were dealing with tabular data (instead of graph data) we would probably use a <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file, if we wanted to keep things simple.
					<strong>But is there anything like a <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file format for graphs?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
					The answer is <em>yes</em>!
					The answer is: <strong>GDF</strong>.
			</p>

				<h2><abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> Format</h2>
				<p>
					The <em><abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr></em> format is a very simple format for storing spreadsheets.
					It looks like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
"Name","DOB","Sex"
"Joe Blow","1922-11-15","male"
"Jane Doe","1980-02-14","female"
"Homer Jay Simpson","1955-05-12","male"
"Philip J. Fry","1974-08-09","male"
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
						An example <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file.
						This <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file has 3 columns:
						<em>name</em>,
						<em><abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr></em> and
						<em>sex</em>.
						Also, this <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file has 4 rows.
						(<a href="figure1.csv">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					As you can see it is a very simple <em>text-based</em> format that is very easy for someone with basic programming skills to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also very well supported, in various software.
					All the major spreadsheet software support it.
					And software that exports (to a spreadsheet file or "to Excel") tend to export to <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as tabular data is concerned, <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> is ubiquitous.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a spreadsheet software package, that example <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file in <em>figure 1</em> might look something like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="figure2.png" />

				<h2>GDF Format</h2>
				<p>
					But <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> is for tabular-type data.
					<strong>Is there something as simple for graph-type data?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer is <em>yes</em>!
				</p>
				<p>
					That is what <strong>GDF</strong> is.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>GDF</em> format is a very simple format for storing <em>graphs</em>.
					It looks like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
a
b
c
d
e
edgedef> node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 3.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>a</em>,
						<em>b</em>,
						<em>c</em>,
						<em>d</em> and
						<em>e</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 4 edges.
						(<a href="figure3.gdf">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					As you can see this too is a very simple <em>text-based</em> format that is very easy for someone with basic programming skills to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also very well supported, in various software.
					(Both Gephi and Guess support it.)
				</p>
				<p>
					In a graph visualization software, it might look something like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="figure4.png" />
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 4.</strong>
						Screenshot of the GDF file shown in <em>figure 3</em> loaded into
						Gephi.

				</figure>
				<p>
					Here are some (more) complex <em>GDF</em> files, just to give you a sense of what <em>GDF</em> files can look like....
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
cherry
c
n235
"Joe Blow"
"a,b,c"
edgedef> node1,node2
cherry,c
n235,c
c,"Joe Blow"
"Jow Blow","a,b,c"
"a,b,c",c
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 5.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>cherry</em>,
						<em>c</em>,
						<em>n235</em>,
						<em>"Joe Blow"</em> and
						<em>"a,b,c"</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 5 edges.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					And....
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
me,"Joe Blow"
friend_1,"Jane Doe"
friend_2,Homer Jay Simpson"
friend_3,"Philip J. Fry"
friend_4,"Sheldon Lee Cooper"
edgedef> node1,node2,weight
me,friend_1,1.1
me,friend_2,7.4
me,friend_3,100.0003
me,friend_4,3.14159265358979323846264338327950
friend_1,friend_2,33.3
friend_1,friend_3,0.000001
friend_2,friend_3,12.345
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 6.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>me</em>,
						<em>friend_1</em>,
						<em>friend_2</em>,
						<em>friend_3</em> and
						<em>friend_4</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 7 edges.
						This GDF file also makes use of the built-in node <em>style</em>.

				<h2>Two Sections To A GDF File Format</h2>
				<p>
					You probably already noticed that a <em>GDF</em> file has 2 section:
					a <em>node-section</em> and an <em>edge-section</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we consider the <em>GDF</em> files in <em>figure 3</em>, the <em>node-section</em> is:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
a
b
c
d
e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 7.</strong>
						<em>Part</em> of the GDF file from <em>figure 3</em>.
						This part of the GDF file lists the nodes in the graph.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					And the <em>edge-section</em> is:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
edgedef> node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 8.</strong>
						<em>Part</em> of the GDF file from <em>figure 3</em>.
						This part of the GDF file lists the edges in the graph.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					If you take what is in <em>figure 7</em> and <em>figure 8</em> and combine them (to get what you have in <em>figure 3</em>) you have a complete <em>GDF</em> file.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Node Labels</h2>
				<p>
					Names can be given label.
					(Labels are human-readable names.)
				</p>
				<p>
					You do this in the <em>node-section</em> with something like:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
a,"Apple"
b,"Banana"
c,"Cherry"
d,"Did it!"
e,"Ed 209"
edgedef> node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 9.</strong>
						An example GDF file, with labels on the nodes.
						(<a href="figure3.gdf">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					In a graph visualization software, it might look something like this: 
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="figure10.png" />
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 10.</strong>
						Screenshot of the GDF file shown in <em>figure 9</em> loaded into
