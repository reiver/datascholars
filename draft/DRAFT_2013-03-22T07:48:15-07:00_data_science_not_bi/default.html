				Perhaps I am misunderstand the authors intend, but
				there is <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/03/18/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist">a blog post</a>
				on the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/">Nature Jobs blog</a> that seems to be conflating
				<em>data science</em> with <em>business intelligence</em>.
				Here is an excerpt from the article:
			</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/03/18/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist">
				<p>
					While programming and statistical expertise is the foundation for any data scientist, a strong background in business and strategy can help jettison a younger scientist's career to the next level.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The article makes it sound like all <em>data scientists</em> do is <em>business intelligence</em>.
				That is false.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take fellow <a href="http:/datascholars.com">DataScholars</a> blogger and data scientist <a href="http://metadatascience.com/">Massoud Seifi</a> (a.k.a <a href="http://twitter.com/accesstoken">@accesstoken</a>).
				He spends his day as a <em>data scientist</em> dealing with questions on (online) identity and fraud detection &amp; prevention.
			</p>
			<p>
				As another example, I am aware of data science positions where the work is focused on computer vision problems.
				(Again, this has nothing to do with <em>business intelligence</em>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I'm sure there are a number of <em>data scientists</em> who use their skills for <em>business intelligence</em>,
				many <em>data scientists</em> apply their <em>data science</em> skills towards problems that have absolutely nothing to do with <em>business intelligence</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For an analogy, it is like someone who has only ever seen software engineers working on iPhone apps; and then declares that all software engineers are iPhone developers.
				Obviously not true.
