				There is <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/03/18/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist">a blog post</a>
				on the <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/">Nature Jobs blog</a> that seems to be conflating
				<em>data science</em> with <em>business intelligence</em>.
				Here is an excerpt from the article:
			</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2013/03/18/so-you-want-to-be-a-data-scientist">
				<p>
					While programming and statistical expertise is the foundation for any data scientist, a strong background in business and strategy can help jettison a younger scientist's career to the next level.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

				The article makes it sound like all <em>data scientists</em> do is <em>business intelligence</em>.
				That is false.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take fellow <a href="http:/datascholars.com">DataScholars</a> blogger and data scientists <a href="http://metadatascience.com/">Massoud Seifi</a>.
				He spends his day as a <em>data scientist</em> dealing with questions on identity and fraud detection &amp; prevention.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although I'm sure there are a number of <em>data scientists</em> who use their skills for <em>business intelligence</em>,
				many <em>data scientists</em> apply their <em>data science</em> skills towards problems that have absolutely nothing to do with <em>business intelligence</em>.
