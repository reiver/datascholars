			<p>
					Sometimes the data you are dealing with is a <em>graph</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
					Before you even start considering how you will view your graph data
					(such as by using <a href="http://gephi.org/">Gephi</a> or <a href="http://graphexploration.cond.org/">Guess</a>, etc)
					you need to (serialize and) store you graph into some kind of <em>file format</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
					If we were dealing with tabular data (instead of graph data) we would probably use a <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file, if we wanted to keep things simple.
					<strong>But is there anything like a <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file format for graphs?</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
					The answer is <em>yes</em>!
					The answer is: <strong>GDF</strong>.
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2><abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> Format</h2>
				<p>
					The <em><abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr></em> format is a very simple format for storing spreadsheets.
					It looks like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
"Name","DOB","Sex"
"Joe Blow","1922-11-15","male"
"Jane Doe","1980-02-14","female"
"Homer Jay Simpson","1955-05-12","male"
"Philip J. Fry","1974-08-09","male"
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
						An example <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file.
						This <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file has 3 columns:
						<em>name</em>,
						<em><abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr></em> and
						<em>sex</em>.
						Also, this <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file has 4 rows.
						(<a rel="enclosure" href="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure1.csv">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					As you can see it is a very simple <em>text-based</em> format that is very easy for someone with basic programming skills to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also very well supported, in various software.
					All the major spreadsheet software supports it.
					And software that exports (to a spreadsheet file or "to Excel") tend to export to <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as tabular data is concerned, <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> is ubiquitous.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a spreadsheet software package, that example <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> file in <em>figure 1</em> might look something like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure2.png"/>

						<strong>Figure 2.</strong>

				</figure>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h2>GDF Format</h2>
				<p>
					But <abbr title="comma separated values">CSV</abbr> is for tabular-type data.
					<strong>Is there something as simple for graph-type data?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer is <em>yes</em>!
				</p>
				<p>
					That is what <strong>GDF</strong> is.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>GDF</em> format is a very simple format for storing <em>graphs</em>.
					It looks like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
a
b
c
d
e
edgedef&gt; node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 3.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>a</em>,
						<em>b</em>,
						<em>c</em>,
						<em>d</em> and
						<em>e</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 4 edges.
						(<a rel="enclosure" href="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure3.gdf">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					As you can see this too is a very simple <em>text-based</em> format that is very easy for someone with basic programming skills to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also very well supported, in various software.
					(Both Gephi and Guess support it.)
				</p>
				<p>
					In a graph visualization software, it might look something like this:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure4.png"/>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 4.</strong>
						Screenshot of the GDF file shown in <em>figure 3</em> loaded into
						Gephi.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Here are some (more) complex <em>GDF</em> files, just to give you a sense of what <em>GDF</em> files can look like....
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
cherry
c
n235
"Joe Blow"
"a,b,c"
edgedef&gt; node1,node2
cherry,c
n235,c
c,"Joe Blow"
"Jow Blow","a,b,c"
"a,b,c",c
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 5.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>cherry</em>,
						<em>c</em>,
						<em>n235</em>,
						<em>"Joe Blow"</em> and
						<em>"a,b,c"</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 5 edges.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					And....
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
me,"Joe Blow"
friend_1,"Jane Doe"
friend_2,Homer Jay Simpson"
friend_3,"Philip J. Fry"
friend_4,"Sheldon Lee Cooper"
edgedef&gt; node1,node2,weight
me,friend_1,1.1

friend_1,friend_2,33.3
friend_1,friend_3,0.000001
friend_2,friend_3,12.345
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 6.</strong>
						An example GDF file.
						This GDF file has 5 nodes:
						<em>me</em>,
						<em>friend_1</em>,
						<em>friend_2</em>,
						<em>friend_3</em> and
						<em>friend_4</em>.
						Also, this GDF file has 7 edges.
						This GDF file also makes use of the built-in node <code>label</code> and <code>weight</code> columns, in the <em>node</em> and <em>edge</em> sections, respectively.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Two Sections To A GDF File Format</h2>
				<p>
					You probably already noticed that a <em>GDF</em> file has 2 section:
					a <em>node-section</em> and an <em>edge-section</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we consider the <em>GDF</em> files in <em>figure 3</em>, the <em>node-section</em> is:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name
a
b
c
d
e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 7.</strong>
						<em>Part</em> of the GDF file from <em>figure 3</em>.
						This part of the GDF file lists the nodes in the graph.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					And the <em>edge-section</em> is:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
edgedef&gt; node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 8.</strong>
						<em>Part</em> of the GDF file from <em>figure 3</em>.
						This part of the GDF file lists the edges in the graph.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					If you take what is in <em>figure 7</em> and <em>figure 8</em> and combine them (to get what you have in <em>figure 3</em>) you have a complete <em>GDF</em> file.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Node Labels</h2>
				<p>
					Nodes can be given a label.
					(Labels are human-readable text.)
				</p>
				<p>
					You do this in the <em>node-section</em> with something like:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
a,"Apple"
b,"Banana"
c,"Cherry"
d,"Did it!"
e,"Ed 209"
edgedef&gt; node1,node2
a,b
b,c
b,d
d,e
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 9.</strong>
						An example GDF file, with labels on the nodes.
						(<a rel="enclosure" href="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure9.gdf">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					In a graph visualization software, it might look something like this: 
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure10.png"/>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 10.</strong>
						Screenshot of the GDF file shown in <em>figure 9</em> loaded into
						Gephi.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Edge Weights</h2>
				<p>
					Weights can be given to edges.
					(These are <em>weights</em> in the <em>graph theory</em> sense of the word.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Building on what we have in <em>figure 9</em>, an example of this is:
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
a,"Apple"
b,"Banana"
c,"Cherry"
d,"Did it!"
e,"Ed 209"
edgedef&gt; node1,node2,weight
a,b,2
b,c,30
b,d,0.4
d,e,200
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 11.</strong>
						An example GDF file, with <em>weights</em> on the nodes.
						(<a rel="enclosure" href="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure11.gdf">download</a>)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					In a graph visualization software, the GDF filei in <em>figure 11</em> might look something like:
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="data/post/2013/03/09/gdf/figure12.png"/>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 12.</strong>
						Screenshot of the GDF file shown in <em>figure 11</em> loaded into
						Gephi.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Note that the graph visualization software, used to create <em>figure 12</em>, represented the <em>edge weights</em> by the <em>thickness</em> and the <em>length</em> of the edges.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>That's All Folks</h2>
				<p>
					And that is really the important stuff when it comes to <em>GDF</em> files.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are some other capabilities, but for most your needs this is enough to know.
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing to keep in mind though: make sure to start the node names with a letter.
					(Else, put the node name into a quoted string.)
				</p>
				<p>
					And <abbr title="by the way">BTW</abbr>. this is what my generated GDF files tend to look like (although usually much much larger):
				</p>
				<figure>
<pre><code>
nodedef&gt; name,label
n11157,"James Wilson"
n12008,"Fred Olson"
n12009,"John Williams"
n12407,"Natalie McDonald"
n14773,"Gwen Nelson"
edgedef&gt; node1,node2,weight
n11157,n12008
n12008,n12009
n12008,n12407
n12407,n14773
</code></pre>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 13.</strong>
						An example GDF file, more typical of what I generate.

				<p>
					Friending recommendation has successfully contributed to the explosive growth of on-line social networks. Most friending recommendation services today aim to support passive friending, where a user passively selects friending targets from the recommended candidates. In this paper, we advocate recommendation support for active friending, where a user actively specifies a friending target. To the best of our knowledge, a recommendation designed to provide guidance for a user to systematically approach his friending target, has not been explored in existing on-line social networking services. To maximize the probability that the friending target would accept an invitation from the user, we formulate a new optimization problem, namely, <em>Acceptance Probability Maximization (APM)</em>, and develop a polynomial time algorithm, called <em>Selective Invitation with Tree and In-Node Aggregation (SITINA)</em>, to find the optimal solution. We implement an active friending service with SITINA in Facebook to validate our idea. Our user study and experimental results manifest that SITINA outperforms manual selection and the baseline approach in solution quality efficiently

			<blockquote cite="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109">
				<p>
					We empirically analyze five online communities: Friendster, Livejournal, Facebook, Orkut, Myspace, to identify causes for the decline of social networks. We define social resilience as the ability of a community to withstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but concentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may trigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may lead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if the size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at least k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit c/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to calculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to infer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online communities. We find that the different online communities have different k-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a different impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on the evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a precursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or even to collapse.

				Can you use <em>machine learning</em> and <em>statistics</em> to predict the gender of someone on Twitter?
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Male or Female?</h2>
				<p>
					If you have spent any kind of time online, then you have probably heard of the various (online) <em>social networks</em> out there.
					Things such as <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Orkut</em>, <em>VK</em> (popular in Russia), <em>Mixi</em> (popular in Japan) and <em>Twitter</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of these social network require you to tell them whether you are a <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>.
					(To some, this information is invaluable.)
				</p>
				<p>
					However, Twitter doesn't
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Twitter</h2>
				<p>
					Twitter in particular, is an interesting social network.
					Both from the point of view of someone using it.
					And from the point of view of someone doing research.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> has made it easy for people to sign up.
					Some websites want to know all your (deepest darkest) details before they let you sign up.
					Twitter doesn't.
					All a person has to provide to Twitter to sign up is a <em>name</em> and <em>e-mail address</em>.
					That's it.
				</p>

					<img src="data/post/2013/03/03/twitter_gender/twitter-signup.png"/>
					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
						Twitter's signup form
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					(You don't have to tell Twitter <em>where you live</em> or your <em>date of birth</em> or <em>gender</em>, etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					And really, the <em>name</em> doesn't even have to be real.
					Using a pseudonym or any other name you want to use is just fine.
					If you want your name on Twitter to be "Panda Puncher", go right ahead.
				</p>
				<p>
					(This is one of the strengths and attractions of Twitter in my opinion.)
				</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h2>Inferring Gender</h2>

				<p>
					Even though Twitter doesn't ask for your <em>gender</em>, doesn't mean no one cares about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					(People involving in <em>advertising</em> care about it a lot. People involved with <em>identity</em>. People involved in fraud detection care too.)
				</p>
				<p>
					But if someone doesn't self-assert their <em>gender</em> (to say they are <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>), <strong>can we infer someone's gender from their Twitter account?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd say the answer is "yes".
					(Probably because I've already worked on commercial projects that did <em>gender prediction</em> with similar types of data :-) )
				</p>
				<p>
					I think you can infer someone's gender without them <em>telling you</em> what it is, based on <em>clues</em> they leave around, with varying degrees of success.
				</p>
				<p><strong>
					Consider, for example, a population that is 50% male and 50% female.
					If you guessed "<em>male</em>" every single time, then (with a random sample) your <em>gender prediction</em> would be accurate 50% of the time.
					This is kind of like the idiom: <em>a stopped clock is right twice a day</em>.

					Any <em>gender prediction</em> engine we consider "good" should do better than this.
					And I can even think of different ways that may work.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>

					<p>
						For example, consider the profile of a friend of mine of Twitter, in <strong>figure 2</strong>.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="data/post/2013/03/03/twitter_gender/harpersnotes-clues.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 2.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/harpersnotes">@harpersnotes</a> with 3 clues useful for <em>gender predication</em> marked in red.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						(Remember, these <em>clues</em> are for a <em>machine learning</em> system to use.
						Of course a human can do this categorization pretty easily, but we want to automate it.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The first clue is the <em>avatar image</em>.
						A <em>photo</em> was used.
						We could use <em>computer vision</em> to infer the gender of that image.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second clue is the <em>given name</em> ("Richard").
						Many <em>given names</em> are highly gender skewed.
						(I suspect there are probably <strong>a lot</strong> more males with the name "Richard" than there are females.
						Which would probably make it a "good" <em>gender predictor</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The third clue probably seems less obvious, but the Twitter profile <em>description</em> can also give a clue to the gender.
						It could be that males and females use language differently, and that the language used in the <em>description</em> is a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is actually a fourth clue not marked in the <strong>figure 2</strong>.
						The Twitter <em>screen name</em> ("@harpersnotes").
						Like the third clue, it could be that males and females use language differently for the Twitter screen name too.
						And thus the words used the Twitter screen name could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, if the Twitter <em>screen name</em> contains a person's <em>given name</em> (ex: <a href="http://twitter.com/tom_hartley">@tom_hartley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bradleyvoytek">@bradleyvoytek</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanLWai">@JonathanLWai</a>),
						then that may be able to be used as a "good" <em>gender predictor</em> as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a possible fifth clue also not shown in <strong>figure 2</strong>, it is conceivable that the location could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
						Perhaps not the location in <strong>figure 2</strong> ("Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA "),
						but say if the location is somewhere where there is a strong gender skew, such as India or China, or even a remote mining town in Northern Canada where the only people living there are mining workers, and all the miners are males.
					</p>
					<p>
						(And Twitter does offer us other <em>clues</em> not shown in <strong>figure 2</strong>.
						Perhaps the Twitter user ID gives us a <em>clue</em>.
						For example, if more males signed up for Twitter in the first 3 years that Twitter existed, and we know that Twitter user IDs with a range between certain numbers are from that era,
						then we can predict <em>male</em> for all users with Twitter user IDs we think are from that era, and predict nothing outside of that.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Now obviously, in general, some of these <em>clues</em> are going to be better <em>gender predictors</em> than others.
						(Perhaps the <em>given name</em> is a better <em>gender predictor</em> than the <em>avatar image</em> because many people don't use photos for their <em>avatar image</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						And for specific profiles, which is <em>gender predictor</em> is accurate will vary; but we expect trends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's an example of another friend whose profile really gives us no clues, or barely any, as seen in <strong>figure 3</strong>:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="data/post/2013/03/03/twitter_gender/rnadomtc-clues.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 3.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/rNadomtC">@rNadomtC</a>.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Probably not much in the way of clues here, in <strong>figure 3</strong>.
						Not unless <em>not giving clues</em> is gender skewed :-)
					</p>
					<p>
						(Note that I'm not trying to list out every possible data source that may be useful for <em>gender prediction</em>.
						I am only trying to give you a "flavor" of the strategies that could be used.
						Is there a gender skew with the apps people use and which send tweets to twitter?
						Is there a gender skew in the <em>time of day</em> people tweet, or retweet, etc?
						Does a person's social network graph (in the <em>graph theory</em> sense of the term) give clues to their gender?
						There are many possibilities one can test and build <em>machine learning</em> systems around.)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Accuracy</h3>
					<p>
						Now, this doesn't mean a single <em>gender prediction</em> strategy will always be 100% accurate.
						(There is very likely going to be some level of error.)
						But these strategies will have some level of accuracy.
						And even with an error, these <em>gender predictions</em> may still be useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You could even (somehow) combine these different <em>gender prediction</em> strategies together, to create a single <em>more accurate</em> strategy for <em>gender prediction</em> with a lower error rate.</strong>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						Developing a <em>gender prediction</em> "engine" really could be done by just taking a reference data set of known male and female accounts and doing some analysis work.
						(I.e., get a set of Twitter accounts that you know the gender for, and use some statistics, machine learning and educated guesses to discover differences between various <em>things</em> that are more common with males than female, and what <em>things</em> are more common with females than males. And use that to come up with a model you can use for making <em>gender predictions</em>.)
						And then validate the resulting model against another (separate) set of Twitter accounts for which you know the gender.
						(Just to verify that your model is a "good" one.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, these "engines" can have all sorts of nuances, special conditions, and may need to be updated from time to time, as past analysis work done may no longer be applicable.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Tweets</h3>
					<p>
						Another <em>clue</em> I have yet to mention (because I wanted to save it for last) are a person's tweets.
						Specifically, the text found in a person's tweet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Are there differences between the way males and females tweet?
						I suspect so (at least some of the time, if not a lot of the time).
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot more can be said about this.

		<p>
			Is gender useful in predicting found?
			Turns out the answer is: <em>sometimes</em>.
			<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/">Eric Barker</a> found <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/05/how-many-women-pay-for-online-porn/">an interesting quote</a> from the book "A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire" that gives an example of when it can matter.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			The most popular paysites featuring adult videos, including Brazzers, Bang Bros, and Reality Kings, typically attract an audience that is around 75 percent men.
			Of course, that does mean that one out of four visitors is a woman -- a minority, though a significant minority.
			But when it comes to actually paying for porn, the gender gap widens into an abyss.
			According to CCBill, the billing service most commonly used by the online adult industry, <strong>only 2 percent of all subscriptions to pornography sites are made on credit cards with women's names.
			In fact, CCBill even flags female names as potential fraud, since so many of these charges result in an angry wife or mother demanding a refund for the misuse of her card.</strong>
