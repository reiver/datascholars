					Data scientists are often interested in getting their hands on (suprise, suprise) <em>data</em>.
					It is the "currency" of their vocation.
					Sometimes they have to go to great lengths to gather the data set themselves.
					And sometimes people will "give" it to them.

				Can you use <em>machine learning</em> and <em>statistics</em> to predict the gender of someone on Twitter?
			</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Male or Female?</h2>
				<p>
					If you have spent any kind of time online, then you have probably heard of the various (online) <em>social networks</em> out there.
					Things such as <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Orkut</em>, <em>VK</em> (popular in Russia), <em>Mixi</em> (popular in Japan) and <em>Twitter</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of these social network require you to tell them whether you are a <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>.
					(To some, this information is invaluable.)
				</p>
				<p>
					However, Twitter doesn't
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Twitter</h2>
				<p>
					Twitter in particular, is an interesting social network.
					Both from the point of view of someone using it.
					And from the point of view of someone doing research.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> has made it easy for people to sign up.
					Some websites want to know all your (deepest darkest) details before they let you sign up.
					Twitter doesn't.
					All a person has to provide to Twitter to sign up is a <em>name</em> and <em>e-mail address</em>.
					That's it.
				</p>

					<figcaption>
						<strong>Figure 1.</strong>
						Twitter's signup form
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					(You don't have to tell Twitter <em>where you live</em> or your <em>date of birth</em> or <em>gender</em>, etc.)
				</p>
				<p>
					And really, the <em>name</em> doesn't even have to be real.
					Using a pseudonym or any other name you want to use is just fine.
					If you want your name on Twitter to be "Panda Puncher", go right ahead.
				</p>
				<p>
					(This is one of the strengths and attractions of Twitter in my opinion.)
				</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<h2>Inferring Gender</h2>

				<p>
					Even though Twitter doesn't ask for your <em>gender</em>, doesn't mean no one cares about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					(People involving in <em>advertising</em> care about it a lot. People involved with <em>identity</em>. People involved in fraud detection care too.)
				</p>
				<p>
					But if someone doesn't self-assert their <em>gender</em> (to say they are <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>), <strong>can we infer someone's gender from their Twitter account?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd say the answer is "yes".
					(Probably because I've already worked on commercial projects that did <em>gender prediction</em> with similar types of data :-) )
				</p>
				<p>
					I think you can infer someone's gender without them <em>telling you</em> what it is, based on <em>clues</em> they leave around, with varying degrees of success.
				</p>
				<p><strong>
					Consider, for example, a population that is 50% male and 50% female.
					If you guessed "<em>male</em>" every single time, then (with a random sample) your <em>gender prediction</em> would be accurate 50% of the time.
					This is kind of like the idiom: <em>a stopped clock is right twice a day</em>.
				</strong></p>
				<p>
					Any <em>gender prediction</em> engine we consider "good" should do better than this.
					And I can even think of different ways that may work.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Examples</h3>

					<p>
						For example, consider the profile of a friend of mine of Twitter, in <strong>figure 2</strong>.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="data/post/2013/03/03/twitter_gender/harpersnotes-clues.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 2.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/harpersnotes">@harpersnotes</a> with 3 clues useful for <em>gender predication</em> marked in red.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						(Remember, these <em>clues</em> are for a <em>machine learning</em> system to use.
						Of course a human can do this categorization pretty easily, but we want to automate it.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The first clue is the <em>avatar image</em>.
						A <em>photo</em> was used.
						We could use <em>computer vision</em> to infer the gender of that image.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second clue is the <em>given name</em> ("Richard").
						Many <em>given names</em> are highly gender skewed.
						(I suspect there are probably <strong>a lot</strong> more males with the name "Richard" than there are females.
						Which would probably make it a "good" <em>gender predictor</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The third clue probably seems less obvious, but the Twitter profile <em>description</em> can also give a clue to the gender.
						It could be that males and females use language differently, and that the language used in the <em>description</em> is a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is actually a fourth clue not marked in the <strong>figure 2</strong>.
						The Twitter <em>screen name</em> ("@harpersnotes").
						Like the third clue, it could be that males and females use language differently for the Twitter screen name too.
						And thus the words used the Twitter screen name could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, if the Twitter <em>screen name</em> contains a person's <em>given name</em> (ex: <a href="http://twitter.com/tom_hartley">@tom_hartley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bradleyvoytek">@bradleyvoytek</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanLWai">@JonathanLWai</a>),
						then that may be able to be used as a "good" <em>gender predictor</em> as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a possible fifth clue also not shown in <strong>figure 2</strong>, it is conceivable that the location could be a <em>gender predictor</em>.
						Perhaps not the location in <strong>figure 2</strong> ("Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA "),
						but say if the location is somewhere where there is a strong gender skew, such as India or China, or even a remote mining town in Northern Canada where the only people living there are mining workers, and all the miners are males.
					</p>
					<p>
						(And Twitter does offer us other <em>clues</em> not shown in <strong>figure 2</strong>.
						Perhaps the Twitter user ID gives us a <em>clue</em>.
						For example, if more males signed up for Twitter in the first 3 years that Twitter existed, and we know that Twitter user IDs with a range between certain numbers are from that era,
						then we can predict <em>male</em> for all users with Twitter user IDs we think are from that era, and predict nothing outside of that.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Now obviously, in general, some of these <em>clues</em> are going to be better <em>gender predictors</em> than others.
						(Perhaps the <em>given name</em> is a better <em>gender predictor</em> than the <em>avatar image</em> because many people don't use photos for their <em>avatar image</em>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						And for specific profiles, which is <em>gender predictor</em> is accurate will vary; but we expect trends.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's an example of another friend whose profile really gives us no clues, or barely any, as seen in <strong>figure 3</strong>:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="data/post/2013/03/03/twitter_gender/rnadomtc-clues.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<strong>Figure 3.</strong>
							Twitter profile of <a href="http://twitter.com/rNadomtC">@rNadomtC</a>.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Probably not much in the way of clues here, in <strong>figure 3</strong>.
						Not unless <em>not giving clues</em> is gender skewed :-)
					</p>
					<p>
						(Note that I'm not trying to list out every possible data source that may be useful for <em>gender prediction</em>.
						I am only trying to give you a "flavor" of the strategies that could be used.
						Is there a gender skew with the apps people use and which send tweets to twitter?
						Is there a gender skew in the <em>time of day</em> people tweet, or retweet, etc?
						Does a person's social network graph (in the <em>graph theory</em> sense of the term) give clues to their gender?
						There are many possibilities one can test and build <em>machine learning</em> systems around.)
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Accuracy</h3>
					<p>
						Now, this doesn't mean a single <em>gender prediction</em> strategy will always be 100% accurate.
						(There is very likely going to be some level of error.)
						But these strategies will have some level of accuracy.
						And even with an error, these <em>gender predictions</em> may still be useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You could even (somehow) combine these different <em>gender prediction</em> strategies together, to create a single <em>more accurate</em> strategy for <em>gender prediction</em> with a lower error rate.</strong>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						Developing a <em>gender prediction</em> "engine" really could be done by just taking a reference data set of known male and female accounts and doing some analysis work.
						(I.e., get a set of Twitter accounts that you know the gender for, and use some statistics, machine learning and educated guesses to discover differences between various <em>things</em> that are more common with males than female, and what <em>things</em> are more common with females than males. And use that to come up with a model you can use for making <em>gender predictions</em>.)
						And then validate the resulting model against another (separate) set of Twitter accounts for which you know the gender.
						(Just to verify that your model is a "good" one.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, these "engines" can have all sorts of nuances, special conditions, and may need to be updated from time to time, as past analysis work done may no longer be applicable.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Tweets</h3>
					<p>
						Another <em>clue</em> I have yet to mention (because I wanted to save it for last) are a person's tweets.
						Specifically, the text found in a person's tweet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Are there differences between the way males and females tweet?
						I suspect so (at least some of the time, if not a lot of the time).
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot more can be said about this.
					</p>

		<p>
			Is gender useful in predicting found?
			Turns out the answer is: <em>sometimes</em>.
			<a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/">Eric Barker</a> found <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/05/how-many-women-pay-for-online-porn/">an interesting quote</a> from the book "A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire" that gives an example of when it can matter.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			The most popular paysites featuring adult videos, including Brazzers, Bang Bros, and Reality Kings, typically attract an audience that is around 75 percent men.
			Of course, that does mean that one out of four visitors is a woman -- a minority, though a significant minority.
			But when it comes to actually paying for porn, the gender gap widens into an abyss.
			According to CCBill, the billing service most commonly used by the online adult industry, <strong>only 2 percent of all subscriptions to pornography sites are made on credit cards with women's names.
			In fact, CCBill even flags female names as potential fraud, since so many of these charges result in an angry wife or mother demanding a refund for the misuse of her card.</strong>
