			In my <a href="http://metadatascience.com/2013/03/11/inferring-facebook-account-creation-date-from-facebook-user-id/">previous post</a>, I explained how we can estimate the account creation date of Facebook accounts that have a 15 digit UID without having to call the Facebook API and just based on the user’s Facebook UID.
		</p>
		<p>
			Table below shows the correlation between Facebook UID and Facebook Account Creation Date for the sample set that I analysed.
			The table is represented in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Facebook UID, Account Creation Date(timestamp), Account Creation Date(date)</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note #1:</strong> To respect the users privacy I hided the last 5 digits of UIDs.
				You may replace ‘x’ by ‘0’ and it should not cause any problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note #2:</strong> For a more accurate result, this table should get updated.

					In the context of preventing and fighting crime, the analysis of mobile phone traffic, among actors of a criminal network, is helpful in order to reconstruct illegal activities on the base of the relationships connecting those specific individuals. Thus, forensic analysts and investigators require new advanced tools and techniques which allow them to manage these data in a meaningful and efficient way. In this paper we present LogAnalysis, a tool we developed to provide visual data representation and filtering, statistical analysis features and the possibility of a temporal analysis of mobile phone activities. Its adoption may help in unveiling the structure of a criminal network and the roles and dynamics of communications among its components. By using LogAnalysis, forensic investigators could deeply understand hierarchies within criminal organizations, for example discovering central members that provide connections among different sub-groups, etc. Moreover, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the contacts among individuals, or by focusing on specific time windows they could acquire additional insights on the data they are analyzing. Finally, we put into evidence how the adoption of LogAnalysis may be crucial to solve real cases, providing as example a number of case studies inspired by real forensic investigations led by one of the authors.

		<p>
			Calling the Facebook API is a (relatively) slow operation; especially if you have to call it multiple times.
			So, when possible, it is a good idea to get the information you need, without making API calls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here I show you how to figure out the <em>creation date</em> of a Facebook account without having to call the Facebook API, just based on the user’s Facebook UID.
		</p>

		<h2>The Bad Way To Do It</h2>
		<p>
			As I explained in <a href="http://metadatascience.com/2013/03/05/how-to-estimate-the-facebook-account-creation-date/">my previous post</a>,
			it is possible to estimate the Facebook account creation date by retrieving the date of user’s oldest post.
			This method has a couple of draw backs:
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Draw Back #1</strong>:
			<img src="../../../data/post/2013/03/15/inferring_fb_creation_date_from_uid/screenshot_read_stream.png" width="356" align="right" height="262" title="read_stream"/>
			You must have <em>‘read_stream’</em> permission which is an extended Facebook permission to read the user post stream.
			From a user’s point of view, this sounds scarier than the other basic permissions you probably ask for.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Draw Back #2</strong>: As an extended permission it triggers a second permission screen that dramatically increases the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">UX</a> friction for the users.
			(You want <em>low</em> friction UX.)
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Draw Back #3</strong>: The overhead of walking the entire post stream to determine age is very costly for the simple piece of information we synthesize.
			(You have to call the Facebook API over and over and over and over … again, since the post stream is paginated.
			I.e., this is at best an O(n) operation, where “n” relates to the user’s activity on Facebook.)
		</p>

		<h2>My Search For A Better Way</h2>
		<p>
			To overcome these issues I tried an to find an alternative, asynchronous approach.
			I was wondering if it is possible to estimate a Facebook account creation date by looking at Facebook User ID.
			I couldn’t find any official documentation on how Facebook generates a new Facebook user ID and how they are accomplishing that in a scalable fashion.
			One answer I could find was from <em>Jack Lindamood, Software Engineer at Facebook 2008-2012</em> which I found <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-1/How-do-Facebook-use-incremented-IDs-for-both-users-and-Pages">here</a>:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				‘Lots’ of MySQL DBs.
				Each with their own unique number.
				Also, each has an autoincrement table.
				Then it’s just some math on the autoincrement value + unique_number * some_cap_per_db (it’s a bit more complicated due to special cases, but that’s pretty much how it works).
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Another explanation was from <em>Justin Mitchell, former engineering manager</em>.
			He explains <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Company-History/What-is-the-history-of-Facebooks-user-ID-numbering-system">here</a> the history of Facebook user ID numbering system:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Facebook’s user ID schema reflects the history of the site as it transitioned from a single-server single-school operation to 400 million users. 
				User ID assignment has gone through several phases, notably:
			</p>
			<p>
				Harvard only.
				Facebook (or thefacebook.com, as it was called back then) was opened up to Harvard running off a single box that had mysql and apache.
				IDs were auto-incremented, starting at 4 (hi Zuck).
			</p>
			<p>
				Other schools.
				Other schools were initially completely separate sites, operating on their own boxes.
				IDs were still auto-increment per SQL box, but each server/school had a different prefix.
				For instance, all Columbia IDs are between 100000-199999 and all Stanford IDs are between 200000-299999.
				You can determine what school any early Facebook user attended based on his or her user ID.
			</p>
			<p>
				High schools.
				Someone must have figured out that this ID system didn’t scale very well, so Facebook changed its DB layout when high schools were introduced.
				While all the college users maintained their current DB, high school users were randomly assigned to one of many many high school DBs.
				These users IDs hash to the correct database, rather than simply being floor(ID / 100000).
			</p>
			<p>
				Open registration.
				Facebook maintained a similar layout once open reg was launched, except the new databases weren’t signified as “high school.”
			</p>
			<p>
				64 bit.
				Given Facebook’s growth rate, it was estimated that the entire world would be on the site by 2011, overflowing 32-bit space.
				While we considered limiting the site to the first 4-billion people to register and lobbying governments to reduce the world’s population, the growth team pushed pretty hard to just increase the ID space to 64-bit.
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Using Facecbook UIDs For Predictions</h2>
		<p>
			So it seems that new Facebook IDs are 64 bits and contain 15 digits.
			There is a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/45/">post</a> dating from October 2007 that mentions that Facebook had plans to do this long time ago but according to this <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/226/">post</a> from May, 2009, Facebook was going to release 64 bit user IDs back to 2009.
		</p>
		<p>
			I studied the correlation between Facebook User ID and Account Creation Date for a <em>tiny sample set</em> of 77 Facebook accounts.
			41 accounts of this sample set had a user ID containing 15 digits and for the rest the user ID has less than 15 digits.
			Figures below illustrate this correlation seperately for 64 bit UIDS (<em>figure 1</em>) and old style UIDs (<em>figure 2</em>).
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="../../../data/post/2013/03/15/inferring_fb_creation_date_from_uid/fbid_age_15.png" width="390" height="390" title="uid==15"/>
			<figcaption>
				<strong>Figure 1.</strong>

		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="../../../data/post/2013/03/15/inferring_fb_creation_date_from_uid/fbid_age_less.png" width="390" height="390" title="uid&lt;15"/>
			<figcaption>
				<strong>Figure 2.</strong>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The graph in <em>figure 1</em> is for the new(er) Facebook UIDs.
			The graph in <em>figure 2</em> is for the old style Facebook IDs.
			You can see that the correlation between Facebook UID and its <em>creation date</em> is <strong>a lot</strong> better for the new(er) Facebook UIDs than the old ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			Or in other words, as we observe, there is an interesting correlation between Facebook User ID and Account Creation Date for 64 bit user IDs (see <em>figure 1</em>).
			Also in this sample set, old UIDs are more than 800 days old (see <em>figure 2</em>).
			The overlap between two graphs might be a period that Facebook was moving from old UIDs to 64 bit ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Therefore as an alternative approach to estimate the Facebook account creation date, we may leverage the monotonically increasing property of 64 bit Facebook user IDs and create a table of bounds that would give us at least a quarterly estimate on the creation date for the account - an appropriate level of granularity for this purpose.</strong>
			Taking this approach will reduce the number of permissions your application need and dramatically decrease the amount of processing time and remove a variable around the elapsed time to deliver a response.

					Tag clouds provide an aggregate of tag-usage statistics. They are typically sent as in-line HTML to browsers. However, display mechanisms suited for ordinary text are not ideal for tags, because font sizes may vary widely on a line. As well, the typical layout does not account for relationships that may be known between tags. This paper presents models and algorithms to improve the display of tag clouds that consist of in-line HTML, as well as algorithms that use nested tables to achieve a more general 2-dimensional layout in which tag relationships are considered. The first algorithms leverage prior work in typesetting and rectangle packing, whereas the second group of algorithms leverage prior work in Electronic Design Automation. Experiments show our algorithms can be efficiently implemented and perform well.

			Facebook <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/">Graph API</a> and <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/">FQL</a> don’t provide you with a simple way of getting the creation date of a Facebook account.
			But if you have a valid Facebook <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer">Access Token</a> with <em>‘read_stream’</em> permission, it is possible to estimate the Facebook account creation date by finding the creation date of the oldest user post.
			According to the Facebook documentation,
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				each query of the stream table is limited to the previous 30 days or 50 posts, whichever is greater, however you can use time-specific fields such as created_time along with FQL operators (such as &lt; or &gt;) to retrieve a much greater range of posts.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Also you must have <em>‘read_stream’</em> permission:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				Querying without the <em>‘read_stream’</em> permission will return only the public view of the data (i.e. data that can be see when the user is logged out).

					We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.
