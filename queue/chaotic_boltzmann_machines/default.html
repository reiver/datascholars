			<p>
				The chaotic Boltzmann machine proposed in this paper is a chaotic pseudo-billiard system that works as a Boltzmann machine.
				Chaotic Boltzmann machines are shown numerically to have computing abilities comparable to conventional (stochastic) Boltzmann machines.
				Since no randomness is required, efficient hardware implementation is expected.
				Moreover, the ferromagnetic phase transition of the Ising model is shown to be characterised by the largest Lyapunov exponent of the proposed system.
				In general, a method to relate probabilistic models to nonlinear dynamics by derandomising Gibbs sampling is presented.
