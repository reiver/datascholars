			<p>
				This thesis describes three families of tools for exploring data and models.
				It is organised in roughly the same way that you perform a data analysis.
				First, you get the data in a form that you can work with.
				Chapter 2 describes the reshape framework for restructuring data.
				Second, you plot the data to get a feel for what is going on.
				Chapter 3 introduces the layered grammar of graphics.
				Third, you iterate between graphics and models to build a succinct quantitative summary of the data.
				Chapter 4 introduces some strategies for visualising models.
				Finally, you look back at what you have done, and contemplate what tools you need to do better in the future.
				Chapter 5 summarises the impact of my work and my plans for the future.
